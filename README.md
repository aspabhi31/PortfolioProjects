## Projects

### 1. Automatic License Plate Detection (ALPD)
**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Overview:**  
Developed an image processing pipeline capable of detecting vehicle license plates under varying lighting and angle conditions.
- Used Gaussian blurring for noise reduction.
- Applied histogram equalization for contrast enhancement.
- Employed adaptive thresholding to handle uneven illumination scenarios.
- Implemented custom contour detection and filtering using geometric criteria (area, aspect ratio, shape).
- Optimized detection accuracy through parameter tuning (Gaussian kernel size, threshold block size, contour area).

### 2. Combined Cycle Power Plant Energy Output Prediction
**Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, scikit-learn  
**Overview:**  
Built a custom linear regression model from scratch to predict net hourly electrical energy output for power plant operations.
- Created a custom gradient descent optimizer to minimize mean squared error.
- Modeled relationships between ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity, exhaust vacuum) and energy output.
- Applied feature scaling (StandardScaler) for stable convergence.
- Generated reproducible predictions and provided test set outputs as CSV.

### 3. Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
**Overview:**  
Trained a logistic regression model to predict Titanic passenger survival.
- Performed robust data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting informative features (e.g., passenger titles).
- Converted cabin presence to binary indicators, dropped irrelevant fields.
- Tuned logistic regression model (using 'saga' solver, with high max iterations and low tolerance).
- Explored ensemble models like Random Forest for comparison.
- Submitted predictions as CSV, with comprehensive feature engineering.
